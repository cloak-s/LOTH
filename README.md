# Live on the Hump: Self Knowledge Distillation via Virtual Teacher-Students Mutual Learning.

![Overview of LOTH](LOTH-MM.png)


This work proposes a novel self knowledge distillation framework named LOTH via virtual teacher-students mutual learning. LOTH constructs auxiliary exits hierarchically, which views each exit as a student and incorporates knowledge form auxiliary exits to build a knowledgeable virtual teacher. The bidirectional mutual learning between virtual teacher and students contributes significantly to the capabilities of multi-exits learning with few training overhead.
